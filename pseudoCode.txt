# Pseudo Code for Snake Game

1. Initialize game variables:
   - gridSize (e.g., 20x20)
   - snake as an array of coordinates (start with length 1 or 2)
   - direction
   - food position (randomly placed on grid, not on snake)
   - score = 0
   - gameOver = false
   - message  = ""
   - soundEffect = {
    eatFoodSound,
    loseGameSound
   }

2. Start game loop :
   - If gameOver, stop loop
   - Move snake in current direction:
     - Calculate new head position based on direction
     - Check for collisions:
       - If new head is outside grid boundaries, set gameOver = true
       - If new head overlaps any part of snake body, set gameOver = true
     - If gameOver, exit loop
   - Check if new head position matches food position:
     - If yes:
       - Increase score
       - Add new head to snake (grow snake)
       - Generate new food position (not on snake)
     - Else:
       - Move snake forward by adding new head and removing tail


3. Listen for user input (keyboard or swipe):
   - On arrow key or swipe:
     - Change direction if not opposite to current direction

4. Handle pause/resume:
   - On pause input, stop game loop timer
   - On resume input, restart game loop timer

5. Handle restart:
   - Reset all variables to initial state
   - Start game loop again

6. Handle sound:
   - Mute the sound

7. End game:
   - Display game over message and final score
   - Option to restart game
